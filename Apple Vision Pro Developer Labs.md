I managed to apply and get approved for Apple Vision Pro Developer Labs in Shanghai, Aug 25.
Here is the preparation of these labs Apple send me:

- Before coming, please build your app against the visionOS emulator. We'll provide you with the items you need to connect to Vision Pro.
- Bring your Mac, source code, and full development environment, along with any necessary peripherals (including Bluetooth keyboards), cables, and gamepads. Your Mac needs the latest Xcode 15 Beta and the visionOS SDK installed in order for you to build and run apps on Vision Pro.
- Once in the lab, you'll need to add a Vision Pro device to the list of provisioned devices, so make sure you have the login credentials for your developer account.
