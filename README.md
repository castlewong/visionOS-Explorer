# visionOS-Explorer

At WWDC2023, Apple finally launched its headset display, it's called: Vision Pro.

> Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others.
> ...visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Apple Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space.

We'd like to explore the possibility of a future that:

> MR (eg. AR/VR) dominate the way we interact with digital machines

This repository stands for a warehouse of collecting the **resources, tutorials, notes and codes** for building visionOS apps and exploring all the possibilities of MR, every contributions of good-value to this repository is welcomed.
