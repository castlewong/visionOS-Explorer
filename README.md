This repository stands for a warehouse of collecting the **resources, tutorials, notes and codes** for building visionOS apps and exploring all the possibilities of spatial computing and MR, every contributions of good-value to this repository is welcomed.

[**SDK for visionOS came out on June 22, 2023**](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode%2015)

## Preface

At WWDC2023, Apple finally launched its headset display, it's called: Vision Pro.

> Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others.
> ...visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Apple Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space.

visionOS combined with Vision Pro, is this the future of the way human interacts with digital machine?

We'd like to explore the possibility of a future that: MR (eg. AR/VR) dominate the way we interact with digital machines

# Developer Kit

> Vision Pro developer kit

To support great ideas for apps and games for visionOS, developer kits will be available to help bring your creations to life on Apple Vision Pro. These kits provide the ability to quickly build, iterate, and test on Apple Vision Pro, so your app or game will be ready to deliver amazing experiences. Stay tuned for how to apply.

> Apple Vision Pro compatibility evaluations

If you currently have an iPad or iPhone app on the App Store, we can help you test it on Apple Vision Pro. Request a compatibility evaluation from App Review to get a report on your app or game’s appearance and how it behaves in visionOS.

> Apple Vision Pro developer labs

Apply for the opportunity to attend an Apple Vision Pro developer lab, where you can experience your visionOS, iPadOS, and iOS apps running on Apple Vision Pro. With direct support from Apple, you’ll be able to test and optimize your apps and games, so they’ll be ready when Apple Vision Pro is available to customers. Labs will be available in six locations worldwide: Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.
