[USD](https://openusd.org/release/intro.html) (Universal Scene Description) is the first publicly available software that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed **from many elemental assets.**

USD provides a [rich toolset](https://openusd.org/release/toolset.html) for reading, writing, editing, and rapidly previewing 3D geometry, shading, lighting, physics, and a growing number of other graphics-related domains. In addition, because USD’s core scenegraph and [composition engine](https://openusd.org/release/glossary.html#composition) are agnostic of any particular domain, USD can be extended in a maintainable way to encode and compose data in other domains.

USDZ is Apple's preferred file format for 3D content.

To download free USDZ files, there are some websites I found can be useful:

1. Apple's AR Quick Look Gallery: Apple provides a collection of free USDZ files on their AR Quick Look Gallery website. You can browse through various categories such as objects, animals, vehicles, and more. Visit the website at: [https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/gallery/](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/gallery/)

2. Sketchfab: Sketchfab is a platform for sharing 3D models, including USDZ files. While not all models are available for free, you can filter the search results to show only free models. Visit the website at: [https://sketchfab.com/](https://sketchfab.com/)

3. TurboSquid: TurboSquid is another popular platform for 3D models, including USDZ files. While many models on TurboSquid are paid, they also offer a selection of free models. You can filter the search results to show only free models. Visit the website at: [https://www.turbosquid.com/](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

4. Free3D: Free3D is a website that hosts a variety of 3D models, including USDZ files. While they have both free and paid models, you can filter the search results to display only free models. Visit the website at: [https://free3d.com/](https://free3d.com/)

And, remember to check the licensing terms and restrictions for each model before using them in your own commercial projects.
