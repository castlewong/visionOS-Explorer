# Diorama
Design scenes for your visionOS app using Reality Composer Pro.

Diorama demonstrates many of RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro's features. It displays an interactive, virtual topographical trail map, much like the real-world diorama you find at trailheads and ranger stations in national parks. This virtual map has points of interest you can tap to bring up more detailed information. You can also smoothly transition between two trail maps: Yosemite and Catalina Island.

To learn more about the features that this sample implements, see [Diorama](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/diorama).
