To download free USDZ files, there are some websites I found can be useful:

1. Apple's AR Quick Look Gallery: Apple provides a collection of free USDZ files on their AR Quick Look Gallery website. You can browse through various categories such as objects, animals, vehicles, and more.

2. Sketchfab: Sketchfab is a platform for sharing 3D models, including USDZ files. While not all models are available for free, you can filter the search results to show only free models. Visit the website at: [https://sketchfab.com/](https://sketchfab.com/)

3. TurboSquid: TurboSquid is another popular platform for 3D models, including USDZ files. While many models on TurboSquid are paid, they also offer a selection of free models. You can filter the search results to show only free models. Visit the website at: [https://www.turbosquid.com/](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

4. Free3D: Free3D is a website that hosts a variety of 3D models, including USDZ files. While they have both free and paid models, you can filter the search results to display only free models. Visit the website at: [https://free3d.com/](https://free3d.com/)

And, remember to check the licensing terms and restrictions for each model before using them in your own commerical projects.
